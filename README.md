# Hacker News dataset analysis

In this project we will be analysing a dataset of submissions to the popular technology site Hacker News (https://news.ycombinator.com/).

Hacker News is a site started by the startup incubator Y Combinator, where user-submitted stories (known as "posts") are voted and commented upon, similar to reddit. Hacker News is extremely popular in technology and startup circles, and posts that make it to the top of Hacker News' listings can get hundreds of thousands of visitors as a result.

The methods used in this analysis were derived from the *Python for Data Science: Intermediate* course provided by Dataquest. Some of the methods used include:

 - Cleaning and preparing data.
 - Summarising numeric data.
 - Formatting strings.
 - For loops.
 - Conditional statements (if...elif...else).
 - Working with dictionaries.
 - Working with dates and times using the Python datetime module.
